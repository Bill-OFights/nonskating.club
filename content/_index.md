Our goal is to provide authoritative, up-to-date guides covering everything non-skating officials need to know to officiate high level play in a WFTDA, JRDA, or MRDA context. This is an independent, open source project not affiliated with or endorsed by any league or governing body.

Check out our latest guides to officiating flat track roller derby below, or [learn](@/about.md) more about the project.
