The Non-Skating Official Guides are open to contributions from the officiating community. Contributions can run the gamut from fixing a typo to writing a brand-new guide.

Here's how to get started.

1. Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com) if you do not already have one. GitHub is a collaboration tool for software developers, and it holds the data that makes up this site.
2. Navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/davidmreed/nonskating.club/tree/main/content/guides) that holds our content.
3. Click on a file that you'd like to edit. If you'd like to add a new guide, click the **Add file** button.
4. Write! If you're new to Markdown, the way we format documents, don't worry about it - just focus on getting the words where you want them. Editors will help you in a later step. If you want to learn about Markdown, try [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/). You'll start to see Markdown everywhere on the web!
