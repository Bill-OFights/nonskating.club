The Non-Skating Official Guides are open to contributions from the officiating community. Contributions can run the gamut from fixing a typo to writing a brand-new guide.

Here's how to get started. We're aware that this procedure is a bit complex, and we're hoping to simplify it in the future. If you'd like to contribute but don't feel comfortable working through GitHub, **you are welcome to copy-and-paste text into an email and send it to [editors@nonskating.club](mailto:editors@nonskating.club).**

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com) if you do not already have one. GitHub is a collaboration tool for software developers, and it holds the data that makes up this site.

## Find Your Workspace

You'll follow different paths based on whether you'd like to edit an existing guide or create a new one.

### Edit an Existing Guide

1. Navigate to the guide you'd like to edit on the site.
1. In the header (where the guide's title is), click "Edit This Guide".
1. If you're not signed in to GitHub, sign in.
1. Click "Fork this repository".

### Create a New Guide

1. Navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/davidmreed/nonskating.club/tree/main/content/guides) that holds our content.
1. Click the **Add file** button.
1. If you're not signed in to GitHub, sign in.
1. Click "Fork this repository".

## Write!

1. Write! If you're new to Markdown, the way we format documents, don't worry about it - just focus on getting the words where you want them. Editors will help you in a later step. If you want to learn about Markdown, try [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/). You'll start to see Markdown everywhere on the web!
1. You can preview your changes by clicking on the Preview tab to see a rendered version.

## Share

1. When you're finished, click "Commit changes..." If you want, you can write a description of your changes in the dialogue box, but it's not required.
1. Click "Propose changes".
1. Click "Create pull request".
1. On the "Open a pull request" page, you can choose to write more about what you've changed any why (it's not required). When you're done, click "Create pull request" again.
1. An editor will review your changes for incorporation to the guide.
