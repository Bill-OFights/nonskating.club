Tell the crew who the heads are, who the coaches, captains, and alternates are.

Deaf and hard of hearing.

JRDA rules level, sudden scoring/injury continuations.

Special facets about the venue.

Escalation paths. What do I want you to do if there's an issue?

## Not Having Enough Officials

A full NSO crew is nine or ten people, depending on whether the Head NSO works a role.

- Head NSO
- PLT x2
- PBM
- PBT x2
- SK x2
- SBO
- JT

Many, many games do not have enough NSOs to fully staff that crew level. THere are a number of options for "gracefully degrading": using fewer officials without negatively impacting gameplay. Your choices on _how_ to do that depend heavily on the experience of your crew and, most of all, on whether or not the game is sanctioned.

### Sanctioned Games

In a sanctioned game, you _must_ staff lineups. The bare minimum crew to run a sanctioned game is therefore five people:

- PLT x2
- PBM
- SBO
- JT

with the Head NSO filling one of those roles. This would be excruciating for the PBM and SBO, who would be at high risk of failing their mandatory responsibilities under the rules. Staffing at this level would likely risk the sanction.

So with a best case of ten and an absolute worst case of five, where do you go if you have, say, seven? Here are some example lineups you could roll out.

8 NSOs:

- PLT x2
- PBT x2 (each managing 3 seats)
- SK x2
- SBO
- JT

- PLT x2
- PBM
- PBT x2
- SK x1
- SBO+SK
- JT

7 NSOs:

- PLT x2
- PBT x2 (each managing 3 seats)
- SK x1
- SBO+SK
- JT

If the game is not sanctioned, you can swap PLT x2 for PT x1 and move the remaining NSO to either SK or PBM, based on your crew's experience level. (Sanctioned games _require_ lineups to be completed). Hence:


- PT x1
- PBT/M x2 or x3
- SK x1 or x2
- SBO or SBO+SK
- JT

6 NSOs:
