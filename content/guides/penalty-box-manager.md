## Introduction

The Penalty Box Manager role comprises support and traffic direction 95% of the time and white-knuckled rules edge cases the other 5%. For most of the game, the PBM simply directs traffic and supports Penalty Box Timers. The other 5% of the time, the PBM smoothly applies complex rule edge cases under pressure and addresses unexpected situations for which there's no clear procedure.

The Penalty Box Manager is not required to complete paperwork. However, awareness of the Penalty Box Timer paperwork is important for the role.

As is the case with many nonskating roles, the Penalty Box Manager role appears nowhere in the Rules of Flat Track Roller Derby, nor does it appear in the Officiating Procedures. The rules and procedures require that _a Penalty Box Official_ perform various duties. The rules are conventionally implemented by staffing one Penalty Box Manager and two Penalty Box Timers. It is legal to staff the penalty box differently, provided that the officials are able to execute duties specified in the rules. 

You'll find (and we note below) some variation in the division of duties between the Penalty Box Manager and Timers.

## Equipment

The Penalty Box Manager uses (at least) two stopwatches for timing penalties. Most host leagues provide stopwatches for the penalty box staff, although many PBMs bring their own. The PBM is responsible for the Penalty Box Whiteboard, a handheld whiteboard that is divided into halves by team, and the markers and erasers for that board. These items are supplied by the host league.

The penalty box is equipped with colored swatches (often fabric, felt, or tape) to mark the seats belonging to each team.

The Penalty Box Manager may choose to wear colored armbands to associate their hand signals with each team's side of the box.

## The Basic Routine

Work from the center of the penalty box, directly behind the two jammer seats. Most penalty box managers work standing, but you are free to sit. You can PBM in a face mask. Some box managers choose to wear colored armbands to reflect team colors. You will have at least two stopwatches.

Watch the track for penalty calls. As each penalty is called, relay as much information about the incoming skater to your Penalty Box Timer as possible. Penalty Box Timers are often required to have their heads down, focused on their paperwork and their stopwatches. The penalty box paperwork requires the skater's number and position. Your communicating these data before the skater is seated helps the Penalty Box Timer manage multiple skaters efficiently.

Direct the skater to an appropriate seat in the penalty box. (Officiating Procedures 7.2). The Penalty Box Timers may also direct skaters. If the skater sits in the wrong seat, request that they move, but ensure that their time is started from their initial arrival. (Casebook C4.4.1.A)

Visual cues used to direct skaters are not standardized. Most Penalty Box Managers use one arm to signal each side of the box (i.e., the skaters from one team). The arm is raised to draw the skater's attention and then lowered to point to the desired seat, repeatedly. 

> Referee: *short whistle* Black 409, low block!<br />
> Penalty Box Manager: *raises arm on Black side of the penalty box*<br />
> Black 409: *Leaves track and skates towards box*<br />
> Penalty Box Manager: Black 409 reporting as Blocker, Black 409 as Blocker.<br />
> Penalty Box Timer: *records Black 409's entry*<br />
> Penalty Box Manager: *directs Black 409 to a seat*<br />
> Penalty Box Timer: *begins timing Black 409 and completes data entry*<br />


The Penalty Box Manager is responsible for timing penalties for the two jammers seated directly in front of them. However, the Penalty Box Timer for the relevant team actually records the penalty on their paperwork. 

Penalties assessed right at the end of the jam often results in surprise reports. 

### Supporting Penalty Box Timers





### Jammer Penalties and Jammer Swaps

The Penalty Box Manager is responsible for timing penalties for the two jammers seated directly in front of them. This allows the PBM to perform _jammer swaps_.

WFTDA resources and training cover jammer swaps in detail. Review:

- Rules 4.4.2
- Casebook C4.4.2
- Learning Training

This guide deliberately does not cover jammer swap scenarios, because they are thoroughly discussed in the official WFTDA resources linked above.

The intricacies of some unusual jammer swaps are not universally understood. For example, A-B-A swaps (where you may have both jammers in the box for a period of time) and double-penalty swaps may confuse skaters, coaches, and other officials. As Penalty Box Manager, it's important that you understood these complex and rarely-seen situations in part because you may be the _only_ official on the track who does understand them. You may need to repeatedly cue a skater, manage chatter from coaches or other officials, or answer questions about what occurred in the box after the jam. Stay calm and be confident in your application of the rules! 

### Managing the Queue

When a team's penalty box is filled with two seated skaters, additional incoming skaters should be returned to the track using the "<Color> <Number>, return to the track" cue. (Rules 4.4.1). This cue is referenced in Officiating Procedures 7.3.1 but is not defined in the Cues, Codes, and Signals document. The hand signal is a "pushing" gesture with an open palm and a horizontally extended arm. 

When you place a skater in queue, write their number and position on the side of your whiteboard for their team. As soon as a seat opens in the box, hold your whiteboard up to have referees or center-based NSOs direct the skater to report to the box. Continue to hold the whiteboard until the skater reports. (Officiating Procedures 7.3).

If the jam ends with a skater or skaters still in queue, hold up your whiteboard during the entire lineup period. This allows the Penalty Lineup Trackers and the Jam Timer to validate that the queued skaters are on track, as required. See Officiating Procedures 7.3.3 and 6.1.1.

Erase queued skaters from your board as they report. Skaters do not have to report in listed order. They should be seated as they report. (Officiating Procedures 7.3.2)

### Foulouts

Rules 4.5 governs foulouts and expulsions.

When a skater reaches seven _or more_ penalties, they have fouled out. You should be prepared for this situation by maintaining awareness of which skaters are already at five or six penalties, relying on your Penalty Box Timers to help you do so. Then, when a penalty call is observed or when the skater approaches the box, you can rapidly confirm that this is the seventh or further penalty with your Box Timer.

Once you have confirmed that a skater has reached seven penalties, signal to the Penalty Lineup Tracker (see XXX), and begin the foulout procedure.

A fouled-out skater is not required to report to the penalty box, provided they remove themselves from the play area. If the skater does not report, their penalty time starts when the box confirms the foul-out via signal to the Penalty Lineup Trackers or when a substitute is seated. (Rules 4.5, Casebook C4.5.C).

The foul-out procedure requires:

- A penalty box seat is considered occupied until the skater is or would be cued to Stand. The seat may be physically occupied by the skater, or may be empty if the skater removed themselves from play. If the skater isn't seated, use a clipboard or other object to mark the seat as taken until the Stand cue would be given. Note that if the skater is serving multiple penalties, they may remain seated for more than 20 seconds.
- When cued to Stand, the skater moves to a designated foulout location. This is usually a spot located directly to one side of or behind the Penalty Box. It may or may not be physically marked.
- When released by the Penalty Box staff, the skater collects any personal items from their bench and leaves the play area. The skater is released at the end of the jam, whether or not time is remaining on their penalty/penalties.
- Any remaining time will be served by a substitute.

Advise a fouled-out skater when they sit that they have fouled out. Instruct them to move to the side of the penalty box when they are cued to stand by the Penalty Box Timer. Once the jam ends, check to see if an Official Review or Official Time Out is immediately called. (Such action could result in the skater's seventh penalty being rescinded). If not, advise the fouled-out skater that they must leave the play area. They may retrieve personal items from the bench before leaving (Officiating Procedures 8.1).

If, at the end of the jam, the skater has time remaining to serve, a substitute must be seated. Depending on placement of the penalty box relative to the team benches, you will often need to rely on your Penalty Lineup Tracker, Head NSO, or a referee to coordinate a substitute with the team captain or coach. You should take responsibility for starting this process with any other officials involved. You may call an Official Time Out if needed, but in the best case a substitution can be handled without an Official Time Out.

In JRDA, you must direct the fouled-out skater to the designated parent chaperone for their team. The parent chaperone does _not_ need to approach the box or enter the play area, but you need to know who and where they are in order to direct the skater to them.

If a skater fouls out but would otherwise be placed in the queue, do not return them to the track. Hold them at the side of the box until a seat is available. See Officiating Procedures 8.4.

Be aware that not all Penalty Box Timers have performed a foulout. You may need to remind Box TImers to continue timing the empty chair after the skater has stood and moved to the side of the box.

### Injuries in the Box

Teams may substitute skaters in the box between jams. See Rules 4.4 and Casebook C.4.4.A. The substitute should arrive at the box to release the seated skater; the skater should not leave without a substitute in the box unless an Official Time Out is in effect to facilitate the substitution. Substitution may be done in response to injury or to equipment failure, such as a broken skate. Ensure that the relevant Penalty Lineup Tracker is aware of the substitution. Substitutions may not occur during play.

If a skater in the box is bleeding, vomiting, or in a state where they cannot safely be returned to play, 

1. Immediately stop the jam and call an Official Time Out.
1. Call for the EMTs to attend the penalty box.
1. If necessary, have the Head NSO or Head Referee locate the person who has the biohazard kit, which is required by the WFTDA Risk Management Guidelines. This person is typically not an official but a member of the host league. They will be responsible for safely cleaning up any bodily fluids or other biohazards.
1. Advise the Penalty Lineup Trackers and the score table that the jam was called due to injury. You may use the nonstandard cue for "called due to injury" by making finger guns and touching the tips of your index fingers together in a horizontal line.
1. Either yourself or through another official (as described above), arrange for a substitute to be seated in the penalty box. Advise the Penalty Lineup Tracker for that team of the substitution.

### Assessing Penalties

The Penalty Box Manager is empowered to assess relevant penalties unless forbidden by the Head Referee. Typically, the Penalty Box Manager will assess penalties related to entry and exit of the penalty box and to skater conduct within the penalty box.

Leaving the penalty box early is an Illegal Procedure.

Removing gear other than the mouthguard while seated is an Illegal Procedure - Equipment Violation. JRDA note: juniors may not remove their mouthguards. Rules 4.4

Anyone other than a penalized skater (such as a coach or teammate) entering the box is an Illegal Procedure. Rules 2.1 and 4.4. Note that putting a foot or skate into the box, or reaching into the box to hand an item to a penalized skater, does not count as entering the box. (XXX CITATION).

What about crossing the box lines on skates?

Profanity may be penalizable. In a WFTDA game, profanity directed at an official or audible by the audience is a Misconduct. In a JRDA game, any profanity is a MIsconduct.

#### Hot Entries

Entering the box "hot" and causing the penalty box bench or chairs to move is a Misconduct. This includes a skater who fails to slow down appropriately, as well as a skater who loses control and hits the box in an uncoordinated manner. You do have discretion to assess this penalty when it is merited by the impact, and not otherwise. You may make this decision based on your assessment of the severity of the incident and the extent to which the skater's disregard for safe entry caused it. For example, sitting down heavily and causing a lightweight or unsecured chair to move slightly when the skater entered carefully and with respect for the safety of the officials does not merit a penalty. Contrarily, entering the box at a high speed or after losing control and causing the box seats to move significantly may merit a penalty.

Causing the penalty box bench or chairs to move in a way that causes the bench or chairs to strike an official is a Gross Misconduct, which merits expulsion. Should this occur, assess the Misconduct penalty and call an Official Time Out following the jam. Recommend to the Head Referee that the skater be considered for expulsion.

See Casebook C4.5.B.

When you assess a penalty, write the skater's number and the penalty code on the appropriate side of your whiteboard. Circle the penalty code to indicate that you are assessing the penalty. Hold your whiteboard up until acknowledged by the Penalty Lineup Tracker.

In the unlikely event that you are not empowered to assess penalties, don't circle the penalty code. Hold the whiteboard up until a referee assesses the penalty. You can also use this procedure if the relevant skater is no longer located in the penalty box area.

Consult Officiating Procedures 7.3.4 for the process to assess a penalty.

### Are You The Jammer?

After an attempted or successful Star Pass, it may not be obvious that a skater entering the penalty box is, or is not, the jammer. A Pivot may enter with the star in their possession; they might be the jammer, but they also might not be in the case of an illegal or incomplete Star Pass. A skater who started the jam as the Jammer may enter without the star in their possession, or with the star in their hand. Even lacking the star, they may still be the Jammer. 

Watch the jam referee for your cue: the skater the jam referee is following is the jammer, save in the case that the jam referee has made an error. If the jam referee is standing facing the box, their jammer is in the box!

If a skater is seated as a blocker, but is actually the jammer, or vice versa, ask the skater to move seats. There should be no change to their timing. You may ask a jammer who is not wearing the star to show the helmet cover. 

### Self-Reports and Rescinded Penalties

Occasionally skaters arrive in the box who do not have a penalty to serve. 

### Conversation in the Box

It's important to be aware that penalized skaters, as well as other participants like coaches, team benches, and announcers or hot microphones, may be able to hear conversation in the penalty box. Even while the penalty flow is limited and you're paying attention to the game, avoid commenting on the game or the performance of teams and skaters. Doing so may create the impression of bias, favor, or lack of professionalism, even if that impression is inaccurate.

Skaters may ask questions of the penalty box staff. You're never required to answer a question if it negatively impacts your duties. You _should_ only answer questions that you have accurate, factual answers to:

- "How much time do I have remaining?"
- "How many penalties do I have?"

are fine because they fall in the scope for which you are directly responsible.

- "What penalty was I called for?"

is fine if you actually heard that information.

- "Where can I reenter the track?"

is not fine; that's coaching.

## Penalty Box Managing in Depth

### What to Check Before the Game

- Ensure that colored badges, if present, are located on the correct side of the penalty box. Each team's seats should be _opposite_ to their bench.
- Know who the captains are. You may need to assess a penalty to the captain in some rare circumstances.

In JRDA, know who the parent chaperones are and how you will direct fouled-out skaters to them. Your Head NSO or Penalty Lineup Tracker may assist by pointing out the chaperone or locating htem during the foulout process. Discuss with those officials to establish how you'll handle this process.

### At Halftime

- Record the color, number, position, and current penalty time for each skater currently in the box on your penalty box whiteboard. (Officiating Procedures 7.6)

### At the start of period 2

- Ensure that all skaters are seated. Hold up your whiteboard to advise the referees and Penalty Lineup Trackers who needs to report, just as with a queue situation after a jam ends. 

### At the end of the game

- Wait until the Jam Timer blows rolling, and then release skaters.
- If needed, assist Penalty Box Timers in readiness to provide penalty totals.

## Communication

### Penalty Lineup Trackers


Signaling 5/6/7

This responsibility is sometimes assigned to the PBTs. Discuss before the game.

### Penalty Box Timers

Providing support, sharing incoming skater information

### Referees

Incoming double penalties
Outgoing box penalties

---

# Excellence in Communication

- **Help your PBTs**.
  - Announce incoming skaters as you direct traffic. "Blue blocker coming in... Blue 23 entering as blocker." Your head is up; your PBTs' are not.
  - Be ready to take a skater on one of your clocks if PBTs are overwhelmed.
- Manage communication of 5, 6, 7 penalties so you're 100% sure of foul-outs.
  - Ask PBTs to tell you at 5, 6, 7 for a skater. Be ready to confirm with the PLT.
  - Call an Official Time Out if counts are off.
