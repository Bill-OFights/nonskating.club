The Penalty Box manager role is a conundrum: 95% of the time, the PBM simply directs traffic and supports Penalty Box Timers. The other 5% of the time, the PBM smoothly applies complex rule edge cases under pressure and addresses unexpected situations for which there's no clear procedure.

## Basic Routine

Work from the center of the penalty box, directly behind the two jammer seats. Most penalty box managers work standing, but you are free to sit. You can PBM in a face mask. Some box managers choose to wear colored armbands to reflect team colors. You will have at least two stopwatches.

The Penalty Box Manager is not required to complete paperwork. However, awareness of the Penalty Box Timer paperwork is important for the role.

Watch the track for penalty calls. As each penalty is called, relay as much information about the incoming skater to your Penalty Box Timer as possible. The penalty box paperwork requires the skater's number and position.

Direct the skater to an appropriate seat in the penalty box.

Penalties assessed right at the end of the jam often results in surprise reports. 

### Supporting Penalty Box Timers





### Jammer Penalties and Jammer Swaps

The Penalty Box Manager is responsible for timing penalties for the two jammers seated directly in front of them. This allows the PBM to perform _jammer swaps_.

WFTDA resources and training cover jammer swaps in detail. Review:

- Casebook C4.4.2
- Learning Training

This guide deliberately does not cover jammer swap scenarios, because they are thoroughly discussed in the official WFTDA resources linked above.

The intricacies of some unusual jammer swaps are not universally understood. For example, A-B-A swaps (where you may have both jammers in the box for a period of time) and double-penalty swaps may confuse skaters, coaches, and other officials. As Penalty Box Manager, it's important that you understood these complex and rarely-seen situations in part because you may be the _only_ official who does understand them. You may need to repeatedly cue a skater, manage chatter from coaches or other officials, or answer questions about what occurred in the box after the jam. Stay calm and be confident in your application of the rules! 


### Managing the Queue

When a team's penalty box is filled with two seated skaters, additional incoming skaters should be returned to the track using the "<Color> <Number>, return to the track" cue (see doc XXX). When you place a skater in queue, write their number on the side of your whiteboard for their team. As soon as a seat opens in the box, hold your whiteboard up to have referees or center-based NSOs direct the skater to report to the box.

If the jam ends with a skater or skaters still in queue, hold up your whiteboard during the lineup period. This allows the Penalty Lineup Trackers and the Jam Timer to validate that the queued skaters are on track, as required.

Erase queued skaters from your board as they report.

### Foulouts

When a skater reaches seven _or more_ penalties, they have fouled out. You should be prepared for this situation by maintaining awareness of which skaters are already at five or six penalties. Then, when the skater approaches the box, you can rapidly confirm that this is the seventh or further penalty with your Box Timer, signal to the Penalty Lineup Tracker (see XXX), and begin the foulout procedure.

Advise a fouled-out skater when they sit that they have fouled out. Instruct them to move to the side of the penalty box when they are cued to stand by the Penalty Box Timer. Once the jam ends, check to see if an Official Review is immediately called. If not, advise the fouled-out skater that they should leave the play area and gear down.

If, at the end of the jam, the skater has time remaining to serve, a substitute must be seated. Depending on placement of the penalty box relative to the team benches, you will often need to rely on your Penalty Lineup Tracker, Head NSO, or a referee to coordinate a substitute with the team captain or coach. You should take responsibility for starting this process with any other officials involved. You may call an Official Time Out if needed, but in the best case a substitution can be handled without an Official Time Out.

In JRDA, you must direct the fouled-out skater to the designated parent chaperone for their team. The parent chaperone does _not_ need to approach the box or enter the play area, but you need to know who and where they are in order to direct the skater to them.

If a skater fouls out but would be placed in the queue, do not return them to the track (see Officiating Procedures). XXX

Be aware that not all Penalty Box Timers have performed a foulout. You may need to remind Box TImers to continue timing the empty chair after the skater has stood and moved to the side of the box.

### Injuries in the Box

If a skater is injured in the box

If a skater in the box is bleeding, vomiting, or in a state where they cannot safely be returned to play, 

1. Immediately stop the jam and call an Official Time Out.
1. Call for the EMTs to attend the penalty box.
1. If necessary, have the Head NSO or Head Referee locate the person who has the biohazard kit, which is required by the WFTDA Risk Management Guidelines. This person is typically not an official but a member of the host league. They will be responsible for safely cleaning up any bodily fluids or other biohazards.
1. Advise the Penalty Lineup Trackers and the score table that the jam was called due to injury. You may use the nonstandard cue for "called due to injury" by making finger guns and touching the tips of your index fingers together in a horizontal line.
1. Either yourself or through another official (as described above), arrange for a substitute to be seated in the penalty box. Advise the Penalty Lineup Tracker for that team of the substitution.

### Assessing Penalties

The Penalty Box Manager is empowered to assess penalties unless forbidden by the Head Referee. Typically, the PEnalty Box Manager will assess penalties related to entry and exit of the penalty box and to skater conduct within the penalty box.

Leaving the penalty box early is an Illegal Procedure.

Removing gear other than the mouthguard while seated is an Illegal Procedure - Equipment Violation. JRDA note: juniors may not remove their mouthguards.

A coach (or teammate?) _fully_ entering the box to XXX is an Illegal Procedure.

What about crossing the box lines on skates?

Profanity may be penalizable. In a WFTDA game, profanity directed at an offiical or audible by the audience is a Misconduct. In a JRDA game, any profanity is a MIsconduct.

Entering the box "hot" and causing the penalty box bench or chairs to move is a Misconduct. This includes a skater who fails to slow down appropriately, as well as a skater who loses control and hits the box in an uncoordinated manner. You do have discretion to assess this penalty when it is merited by the impact, and not otherwise. You may make this decision based on your assessment of the severity of the incident and the extent to which the skater's disregard for safe entry caused it. For example, sitting down heavily and causing a lightweight or unsecured chair to move slightly when the skater entered carefully and with respect for the safety of the officials does not merit a penalty. Contrarily, entering the box at a high speed or after losing control and causing the box seats to move significantly may merit a penalty.

Causing the penalty box bench or chairs to move in a way that causes the bench or chairs to strike an official is a Gross Misconduct, which merits expulsion. Should this occur, assess the Misconduct penalty and call an Official Time Out following the jam. Recommend to the Head Referee that the skater be considered for expulsion.

When you assess a penalty, write the skater's number and the penalty code on the appropriate side of your whiteboard. Circle the penalty code to indicate that you are assessing the penalty. Hold your whiteboard up until acknowledged by the Penalty Lineup Tracker.

In the unlikely event that you are not empowered to assess penalties, don't circle the penalty code. Hold the whiteboard up until a referee assesses the penalty.

### Are You The Jammer?

After an attempted or successful Star Pass, it may not be obvious that a skater entering the penalty box is, or is not, the jammer. A Pivot may enter with the star in their possession; they might be the jammer, but they also might not be in the case of an illegal or incomplete Star Pass. A skater who started the jam as the Jammer may enter without the star in their possession, or with the star in their hand. Even lacking the star, they may still be the Jammer. 

Watch the jam referee for your cue: the skater the jam referee is following is the jammer, save in the case that the jam referee has made an error. If a skater is seated as a blocker, but is actually the jammer, or vice versa, ask the skater to move seats. There should be no change to their timing. You may ask a jammer who is not wearing the star to show the helmet cover. 

### Self-Reports and Rescinded Penalties

Occasionally skaters arrive in the box who do not have a penalty to serve. 

### Conversation in the Box

- Don't let conversation about the game be audible to skaters
- Answering questions from skaters.

## What to Check

### Before the Game

- Ensure that colored badges, if present, are located on the correct side of the penalty box. Each team's seats should be _opposite_ to their bench.
- Know who the captains are. You may need to assess a penalty to the captain in some rare circumstances.

In JRDA, know who the parent chaperones are and how you will direct fouled-out skaters to them. Your Head NSO or Penalty Lineup Tracker may assist by pointing out the chaperone or locating htem during the foulout process. Discuss with those officials to establish how you'll handle this process.

### At Halftime

- Record the color, number, position, and current penalty time for each skater currently in the box on your penalty box whiteboard.

### At the start of period 2

- Ensure that all skaters are seated. Hold up your whiteboard.

### At the end of the game

- Wait until the Jam Timer blows rolling, and then release skaters.
- If needed, assist Penalty Box Timers in readiness to provide penalty totals.
