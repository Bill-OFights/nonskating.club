## Introduction

The Scoreboard Operator (SBO) is the control center of the game.  The official score, period time, jam/lineup times, and game status (in-play, current jammers, timeouts, reviews, etc) are deemed to be what is visible to all attendees, and ideally this will be managed by the SBO.  This also means that the SBO must know *when, how or if corrections can be made* as per WFTDA rules.

The ideal placement during a game for the SBO is between the Scorekeepers, ideally with the Scorekeepers seated on the same side as their team is on the scoreboard controls i.e.: If the system has the Red team on the left and Blue team on the right, the Red Scorekeepers should be seated to the left and Blue Scorekeeper to the right.  Scoreboard Operator should also be in a position to clearly see the Jam Timer and any Head Officials in the infield, as well as being able to see the scoreboard to validate that it is working throughout the game.

- [The Rules of Flat Track Roller Derby](https://rules.wftda.com/)
- [CRG Scoreboard Wiki] (https://github.com/rollerderby/scoreboard/wiki) CRG is by far the most popular if not only scoreboard software you're likely to encounter in the wild.  A guide specifically to CRG operations will be added later. (TODO)

The role of SBO is not well defined by the WFTDA Officiation Procedure Guide, as the specifics will vary based on the software or physical hardware used at each venue.  Scoreboard Operations is mostly defined as reacting to other Officials in order to relay information to attendees, so understanding the rules regarding time and score corrections or how to communicate this information is critical.

## The Basic Routine

During gameplay, an SBO's primary duties, in order of priority, are to:
1. Work with the Scorekeepers to ensure the displayed information is accurate.
2. Document (or validate if using electronic Penalty and Lineup Tracking) both Jammers and Pivots for each jam.
3. Make sure Jams are started/ended on time.
4. Work with the Jam Timer and head officials to ensure the game clocks are accurate
5. Display team timeouts or official reviews are correctly reported under the requesting team, or that official timeouts are clearly noted.
6. Deal with any problems with the scoreboard itself. 

### 1. Working with Scorekeepers
During a typical Jam, the Scorekeepers should be focusing on their respective Jam Referee and Jammers, and calling out key events as they occur:
1. Lead Jammer awarded
2. Initial pass completed
3. Points earned on the pass
4. Star passes
5. Jam called or ended by the Jam Timer

The SBO should echo these calls to the Scorekeeper as they are entered into the Scoreboard, both to confirm the information and to acknowledge the call.  If the SBO notices a call while the Scorekeeper is otherwise distracted (making corrections, unable to see the Jam Ref, documenting a Star Pass, etc), the SBO should confirm the call with the Scorekeeper before inputting it into the system.

### 2. Documenting Jammer and Pivots
If the venue is using electronic Penalty and Lineup Tracking (ePLT) devices, it is possible this task will be handled by the PLTs themselves.   If not, at the start of each Jam it is essential that the Scorekeepers know who their Jammers and Pivots will be.   The SBO should input this information into the scoreboard so it can be displayed for announcers and attendees as well.

### 3. Starting and Ending Jams
__The official Period time, Lineup, and Jam time remaining are what is displayed on the scoreboard.__   As such, it is paramount that the scoreboard reflect this accurately.  Jams begin when the Jam Timer whistles and gives their hand signal, Jams end at the 1st cycle of the 4-whistle cadence to call off a Jam.   After any timeout, the next Jam must begin within 30 seconds of the rolling whistle.   While it is the Jam Timer's duty to initiate these signals, the SBO must be ready to update the official display for the attendees.

### 4. Ensure Clock Time Is Accurate
Following along with point 3, there will always be some natural drift between the signals from other officials and the SBO.   Half a second is frequently gained or lost at the start of a Jam simply due to human error or delays in the scoreboard input.   While each crew may decide on what an acceptable limit is based on the game, any  difference between the official time and the Jam Timer's backup game watch should be weighed for it's impact and the official time adjusted accordingly.   Anything more than 1-2 seconds should be considered impactful enough to warrant pausing gameplay between Jams to make the correction.

In May 2024 WFTDA released revised rules that declare the Period clock should stop when a timeout/official review is REQUESTED, not when it is AWARDED.  As an example
> Jam #18 ends, both teams begin returning to their respective benches.
> While the Lineup clock on the scoreboard reports we are 3 seconds into the Lineup, Red team captain stands up and immediately uses both the "O" hand signal and verbal call for an Official Review.
> Due to both teams taking the track and obstructing the view, neither the Jam Timer nor any Inside Pack, Jam, or the Head Ref initially see or hear the Red captain.
> An Outside Pack Ref starts to take their position for the start of the next Jam, sees Red Captain, and immediately signals a 4-whistle cadence and echoes the captain's call for an Official Review, Head Ref echoes the whistle and calls the Official review.   The scoreboard now reports we are 21 seconds into the Lineup period.

The new rules would state in this case, after updating the scoreboard to reflect a Team Official Review but before gameplay resumes,  the SBO should restore the time lost while the Red captain was trying to get officials attention.  The exact amount of time restored to the clock should be ultimately be decided by the Jam Timer, Head NSO and Head Ref before being communicated to the SBO to restore in this case the missing 18 seconds.

### 5. Display Team Timeouts, Official Reviews, and Official Timeouts Correctly
In addition to having all game clocks displayed correctly, the SBO is also responsible for confirming all timeouts and reviews requested are allocated from the appropriate team, and that the scoreboard shows the correct number of remaining reviews and timeouts for each team.

### 6. Dealing With Scoreboard Problems
Like any piece of technology, a scoreboard will occasionally malfunction.  This may require the SBO to simply click the "Unstart Jam" or "Un-Timeout" buttons to roll back to the correct game state, this may require the SBO to be ready to fallback to a purely manual dry erase board and markers while rebooting the scoreboard laptop.
