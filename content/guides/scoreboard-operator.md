## Introduction

The Scoreboard Operator (SBO) is the control center of the game.  The official score, period time, jam/lineup times, and game status (in-play, current jammers, timeouts, reviews, etc) are deemed to be what is visible to all attendees, and ideally this will be managed by the SBO.  This also means that the SBO must know *when, how or if corrections can be made* as per WFTDA rules.

During gameplay, an SBO's primary duties, in order of priority, are to:

1. Work with the Scorekeepers to ensure the displayed score is accurate
2. Make sure Jams are started/ended on time
3. Work with the Jam Timer and head officials to ensure the game clocks are accurate
4. Make sure timeouts and official reviews are correctly reported
5. Deal with any problems with the scoreboard itself. \

The ideal placement during a game for the SBO is between the Scorekeepers, ideally with the Scorekeepers seated on the same side as their team is on the scoreboard controls (i.e.: If the system has the Red team on the left and Blue team on the right, the Red Scorekeepers should be seated to the left and Blue Scorekeeper to the right.)
